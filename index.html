        <p class = "aboutpara"> We are a nonprofit art gallery located in the Back Bay area of Boston. We pride ourselves in highlighting new and innovative artists, whose passion is to show the world their work. We were founded just a few years ago in 2014 and have shown artists' work from all around the world. We offer an array of events ranging from art classes and film nights. One of our main goals is to allow patrons to feel as if they're entering into another world. We want to mimic the freeing and euphoric feeling of being in nature, but with art instead.</p>
